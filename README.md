**Dartoos** â€” Dart Object-Oriented Software

This package is a collection of object-oriented Dart primitives that implement
classic data structures, algorithms, encoding/decoding, encryption and more. It
is aimed to serve as a base framework for more specific packages.

**Motivation**: These data structures and algorithms have been implemented in
Dart by other packages already, but there are some issues with them:

- None of them is pure object-oriented. Indeed they do their job, but mostly
  through static methods, mixins, procedures, etc.
- These packages are spread throughout the pub.dev ecosystem. This means that a
  user need to find different packages for basic things like encryption,
  encoding, or even for a plain `Queue` data structure.

This project is heavily inspired by Java

## Features

- No external dependencies.
- Object-Oriented mindset: each concept is implemented by an **immutable** class.
- Straightforward integration with the underlying Dart sdk.
